### Dev History

### Current Skillset

- Automation / Web Tools: Zapier, Google Tag Manager
- Project Management: ZenDesk, Zoho, Asana, Trello, Slack, Discord

### Tech Skills

Many years of development jobs, and freelancing for dozens of clients has given me experience with a wide range of technology which I am familiar with but do not make up my current core skillset. The following is a short list of these types of skills, in no particular order:

Cold Fusion, Google Apps Script, Webflow, Perl, MS SQL, ImageMagick, Automator for Mac.

### Open Source

A GitHub member since 2011, I am a big supporter, user, and promoter of open source software. I'm making it a goal to share more of my own work, and contribute to more open source projects to further support the community.
