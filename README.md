### Dev History

I have been coding for three decades, starting with the Apple II and the Amiga, moving to Windows and web development, then to Linux, MySQL, and Perl, and more recently WordPress, Python, and mobile apps using Objective-C.

### Freelance Work

I'm currently a full time freelancer, with a focus on WordPress, iOS apps, and day-to-day client support (hosting, DNS, task automation, etc).

### Open Source

A GitHub member since 2011, I am a big supporter, user, and promoter of open source software. I'm making it a goal to share more of my own work, and contribute to more open source projects to further support the community.
